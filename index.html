  <h1>Welcome to this old house.</h1>

  <p>
    I write stuff and abandon it around this time (September to December) every year.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page is a memorial to those projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I had the energy I'd throw some late 90s/early 2000s Geocities type GIFs
    all over the place. I don't have the energy though. So here we are.

  <h2>Some Things I'm Currently Working On</h2>
  <h3>xmachine</h3>
  <h5>Context</h5>
  <p>
    The idea was to write an emulator of some kind, but I eventually
    wanted to turn it into a PDP-11 for some reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    So it's basically PDP-11 machine code, PDP-11 registers, and some
    PDP-11-like components. It has a disk controller of sorts to read and write to
    disk images.
  </p>
  <h5>Present Date</h5>
  <p>
  Working on rewriting all the components to be standalone programs, which
  interact through the Unibus (provided by UNIX file sockets). Each program will
  use libunibus to handle its bus interaction. The idea being there's a main
  thread (stuff the device does), a priority bus thread (handles getting access
  to the data bus and passing grants/other signals passively), and a data bus
  thread (handles data input/ouput either as bus master or slave).
  </p>
  <p>
  After that is done, I'm probably going to focus on targeting a specific
  PDP-11 processor, ripping out <tt>tty/</tt> and implementing a VT100, or
  something similar, and other stuff I haven't given much thought to yet.

  <h2>Some Things I've Worked On</h2>
  <h5>(In recent hobby seasons)</h5>

  <h3>slippy</h3>
  <p>
  I remember wanting to write a Scheme interpreter in Rust that implemented the
  R5RS specification. I can't remember how far I got. I know macros don't exist,
  which is where it kind of died.
  </p>
  <p>
  It does support function definitions and some other things. A highlight of
  its functionality is in the examples directory in the repo. There is a
  mini-Forth-like interpreter program.

  <h3>fslib</h3>
  <p>
    So this was a continuation, or final completion, of the goal of getfat. That goal was to
    write a program to read and write to FAT32 images.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extended goal, which I haven't finished and will probably come back to, is to support
    multiple file system formats.

  </ul>

  <h3>chains</h3>
  <p>
    I wanted to write a 6502 emulator and after it was kind of working I decided to bolt on handling NES ROMs.
    It does not do the bolted on part well (or at all, unless "well" is defined as just showing Balloon Fight's title
    screen).
    It possibly doesn't even do the non-bolted on part well. So it goes.
