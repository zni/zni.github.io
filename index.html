    <h1>Welcome to this old house.</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      I write stuff and abandon it around this time (September to December) every year.
      So here I am again, continuing the tradition. This year though, I'm taking stock of
      what I created and abandoned in previous years. Sometimes adding a README, or going back through
      code that feels like it was written in a fugue state and struggling to remember what I was thinking.
    </p>

    <h2>Some Things I've Worked On</h2>
    <h5>(In recent hobby seasons)</h5>

    <h3>xmachine</h3>
    <p>
      The idea was to write an emulator of some kind, but I eventually
      wanted to turn it into a PDP-11 for some reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's basically PDP-11 assembly, and some PDP-11-like components. It has a disk controller
      of sorts to read and write to disk images.

    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>fslib</h3>
    <p>
      So this was a continuation, or final completion, of the goal of getfat. That goal was to
      write a program to read and write to FAT32 images.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extended goal, which I haven't finished and will probably come back to, is to support
      multiple file system formats. I haven't started on that part, but this seems like a good
      hobby season for that.
