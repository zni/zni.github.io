<p>Currently playing around with the simple functional language from
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Programming-Languages-Daniel-Friedman/dp/0262062798/">EOPL</a>.
I previously implemented the language from chapter 3 in Haskell, which is on my
<a href="https://github.com/zni/island">github</a>. This time around I rewrote it in
Scheme working from memory, however I'm skipping out on using the SLLGEN
parsing system that is used by the book. My eventual goal, after finishing the
continuation chapters, is to move on to writing my own frontend for it in the
form of a lexer and parser.</p>
