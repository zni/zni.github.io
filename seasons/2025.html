    <p>
        Working on updating <a href="https://github.com/zni/fslib">fslib</a>.<br>
        <br>
        I wanted to cozy up to a spec and implement something. So I'm working on
        supporting different FATs in the FAT section of the library.<br>
        <br>
        I intend to add ext2 support, but let's not get too crazy.

        I kind of wish I just wrote the library in C, although maybe I'll get
        Stockholm syndrome and learn to love Go.
