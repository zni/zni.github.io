  <h3>2025-10-11</h3>
  <p>
  What is new around these parts?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>fslib has been backburnered.</li>
    <li>xmachine is back in business.</li>
    <li>slippy is still dead.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  With working on xmachine:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm going back to C from C++.</li>
    <li>Tearing out all the ncurses and threading stuff I added.</li>
    <li>Writing a sort of Unibus with UNIX sockets, featuring bus arbitration.</li>
    <li>Rolling with a.out as the executable format for loading assembled code.</li>
    <li>Possibly picking a PDP-11 CPU and sticking with it.</li>
    <li>Other things I don't feel like enumerating.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  When the above is not happening, I've been messing around with random stuff
  (pf mostly), reading man pages and RFCs recreationally, and swimming in the
  ocean of computing history.

  <h3>2025-09-28</h3>
  <p>
  Dug <a href="https://github.com/zni/slippy">slippy</a> out of its grave and
  updated its dependencies. Also, it now has a somewhat functional README.
  </p>
  <p>
  After living for a year or more in VSCode, I've returned to VIM and my
  terminal roots. Feels good. I don't know why, but it does.
  </p>
  <p>
  Learning to embrace <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">lynx</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, reading through the QEMU source and thinking about adding a (user?) target.
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, finally, might rewrite fslib to use Rust.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-09-27</h3>
  <p>
  10 days, of doing nothing, later, here we are.<br>
  Working on getting FAT16 working and probably not much else.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-09-17</h3>
  <p>
    After wasting like 4 days, I've finished restructuring fslib.<br>
    I no longer know why I set out to do this. Maybe when I start actually
    implementing other file systems I'll have the answer to that.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-09-14</h3>
  <p>
    Still in fslib towne.<br>
    <br>
    After discovering generics in Go, I've spent today restructuring
    the FAT portion of the library.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-09-13</h3>
  <p>
    Working on updating <a href="https://github.com/zni/fslib">fslib</a>.<br>
    <br>
    I wanted to cozy up to a spec and implement something. So I'm working on
    supporting different FATs in the FAT section of the library.<br>
    <br>
    I intend to add ext2 support, but let's not get too crazy.
  </p>
  <h4>Irrelevant trivia portion of the show</h4>
  <p>
    I kind of wish I just wrote the library in C, although maybe I'll get
    Stockholm syndrome and learn to love Go.
