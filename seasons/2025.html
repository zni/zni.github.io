  <p>
  10 days, of doing nothing, later, here we are.<br>
  Working on getting FAT16 working and probably not much else.

  <p>
    After wasting like 4 days, I've finished restructuring fslib.<br>
    I no longer know why I set out to do this. Maybe when I start actually
    implementing other file systems I'll have the answer to that.

    Still in fslib towne.<br>
    <br>
    After discovering generics in Go, I've spent today restructuring
    the FAT portion of the library.

  <h3>2025-09-13</h3>
  <p>
    Working on updating <a href="https://github.com/zni/fslib">fslib</a>.<br>
    <br>
    I wanted to cozy up to a spec and implement something. So I'm working on
    supporting different FATs in the FAT section of the library.<br>
    <br>
    I intend to add ext2 support, but let's not get too crazy.
  </p>
  <h4>Irrelevant trivia portion of the show</h4>
  <p>
    I kind of wish I just wrote the library in C, although maybe I'll get
    Stockholm syndrome and learn to love Go.
