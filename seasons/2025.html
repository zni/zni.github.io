  <h3>2025-11-08</h3>
  <p>
  Long time no talk. Unibus continues.
  </p>
  <p>
  Almost done with the priority bus part of the library... I think.
  </p>
  <p>
  Haven't had much time to follow through on my ideas, outside of setting up
  pthread condition signals for blocking the main thread. Since if it needs to
  wait on data to or from the bus, it needs to block.
  </p>
  <p>
  The cpu (or processor) device is the first to be on the receiving end of
  using the stuff I talked about above. Probably memory is next up after that.
  </p>
  <p>
  Once those two are done, I should be able to start up the bus arbitrator,
  cpu, and memory devices and run something. I probably need a bus terminator
  too, but I'm running on the assumption that anything needing a grant will block
  it and not pass it so that it rots in limbo forever.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-10-26</h3>
  <p>
  Continuing with Unibus for xmachine. Now with diagrams!
  </p>
  <p>
  The diagrams I ended up making of the abomination I'm designing helped me
  find some gaps in my thinking. I'm genuinely surprised it wasn't a waste of time.
  </p>
  <p>
  In any case, maybe sometime next month the bus interaction library will be
  done. Mostly since I probably get to spend like 4-6 hours total on this in a
  week. All of those hours being located on the weekend and succeptible to
  reallocation.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-10-18</h3>
  <p>
  Not much has changed in 7 days. Finally finished taking notes on the Unibus
  spec and somehow synthesized that into a way forward.
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm still working on xmachine. Mainly, designing a Rube Goldberg machine of
  sorts to handle PDP-11 Unibus. The bus arbitrator is kind of done, so now it's
  on to getting the bus interaction library finished. Then that library can then
  be bolted on to all the other devices to handle priority requests/data transfers.
  </p>
  <p>
  I guess that's it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-10-11</h3>
  <p>
  What is new around these parts?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>fslib has been backburnered.</li>
    <li>xmachine is back in business.</li>
    <li>slippy is still dead.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  With working on xmachine:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm going back to C from C++.</li>
    <li>Tearing out all the ncurses and threading stuff I added.</li>
    <li>Writing a sort of Unibus with UNIX sockets, featuring bus arbitration.</li>
    <li>Rolling with a.out as the executable format for loading assembled code.</li>
    <li>Possibly picking a PDP-11 CPU and sticking with it.</li>
    <li>Other things I don't feel like enumerating.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  When the above is not happening, I've been messing around with random stuff
  (pf mostly), reading man pages and RFCs recreationally, and swimming in the
  ocean of computing history.
  </p>

  <h3>2025-09-28</h3>
  <p>
  Dug <a href="https://github.com/zni/slippy">slippy</a> out of its grave and
  updated its dependencies. Also, it now has a somewhat functional README.
  </p>
  <p>
  After living for a year or more in VSCode, I've returned to VIM and my
  terminal roots. Feels good. I don't know why, but it does.
  </p>
  <p>
  Learning to embrace <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">lynx</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, reading through the QEMU source and thinking about adding a (user?) target.
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, finally, might rewrite fslib to use Rust.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-09-27</h3>
  <p>
  10 days, of doing nothing, later, here we are.<br>
  Working on getting FAT16 working and probably not much else.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-09-17</h3>
  <p>
    After wasting like 4 days, I've finished restructuring fslib.<br>
    I no longer know why I set out to do this. Maybe when I start actually
    implementing other file systems I'll have the answer to that.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-09-14</h3>
  <p>
    Still in fslib towne.<br>
    <br>
    After discovering generics in Go, I've spent today restructuring
    the FAT portion of the library.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>2025-09-13</h3>
  <p>
    Working on updating <a href="https://github.com/zni/fslib">fslib</a>.<br>
    <br>
    I wanted to cozy up to a spec and implement something. So I'm working on
    supporting different FATs in the FAT section of the library.<br>
    <br>
    I intend to add ext2 support, but let's not get too crazy.
  </p>
  <h4>Irrelevant trivia portion of the show</h4>
  <p>
    I kind of wish I just wrote the library in C, although maybe I'll get
    Stockholm syndrome and learn to love Go.
